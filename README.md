# 2Market - 88% Final Grade 

Project Summary: In a fictional situation I helped 2Market, a leading international supermarket chain, leverage data analytics to gain deeper customer understanding to boost sales. By analysing consumer datasets, I uncovered valuable insights into customer behaviour, sales trends, and advertising effectiveness.

Analytical Approach Highlights:
- Cleaned and Preprocessed Data: Ensured data quality by meticulously identifying and addressing inconsistencies, improving database interactions, and guaranteeing completeness. 
- Advanced SQL Analysis: Utilised SQL to conduct in-depth analyses, including total spend per country, demographic-based product popularity, and advertising platform performance. These insights revealed hidden patterns for informed decision-making.
- Actionable Dashboards: Designed user-friendly dashboards segmented by demographics, ad data, and product interactions. These dashboards followed WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative) guidelines for accessibility, allowing stakeholders to easily grasp key findings.
- Strategic Recommendations: Delivered actionable insights with a direct impact on 2Market's strategy. This included optimising advertising spend, tailoring marketing for specific demographics, and adjusting product categories based on customer preferences.

Key Insights and Recommendations:
- Identified a core customer demographic of 58-68 year-olds with higher product spend, recommending targeted marketing to leverage purchasing power.
- Determined Twitter and Instagram as highly effective ad platforms globally; identified regional opportunities like the presence of Facebook in the U.S.
- Advised reevaluation of brochure efficacy, pointing towards a shift in marketing tactics for improved engagement.
- Highlighted bulk emails' success in South Africa, India, and the U.S., recommending increased focus on personalised email campaigns.
- Proposed ad platform diversification, noting TikTok's superior revenue performance for innovative consumer engagement strategies.
- Revealed liquor and meat as top global product categories, suggesting intensified marketing efforts for these segments.

Professional Development and Impact: 
- This project showcased my ability to manage large datasets, translate complex data into business insights, and deliver strategic recommendations.In particular I felt an extensive use of SQL played a central role in uncovering critical customer insights, guiding the supermarket chain toward strategic sales enhancements.
